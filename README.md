# Oculus Quest - Intel RealSense Integration
Integration of Intel RealSense depth cameras with the Oculus Quest standalone VR headset using Unity.


## Foreword

<br/>

This project consolidates the knowledge gained while attempting to power & operate a RealSense D435i camera directly from an Oculus Quest VR headset. 

At the time of this attempt (5th-12th of June 2019), no prior work on this specific problem was available in the public realm, and the solution wouldn't be possible without the valuable contribution of members of the Intel development team.

The discussion which led to the solution, is available [here](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/4155), for future reference.

Aim of this project is to describe the steps necessary to achieve the Quest-RealSense integration inside Unity 2019.x, as well as to provide simple and generic source code.
